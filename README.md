For Paper Replication Assignment 1
  Step 1: Download all files into a seperater folder.
  Step 2: Excel files named exports, imports, and gross_output, and matlab file replication_d1.m are used to compute the Import Penitration Ration (IPR), generating ipr_final.xlsx
          We then filter this file inh matlab such that we only have 4 sectors (justification discussed in the accompanying pdf file) to get ipr_filtered.xlsx
  Step 3: Excel file pld_ggdc.xlsx and matlab file replication_part2.m are used to generate an equivalent Table 2 from the paper for all 12 sectors, and format the results into latex manualy on overleaf.
  Step 4: We manually filter (in excel not matlab) the relative prodctivity values computed in table 2 to include only the 4 sectors (Agriculture, Manufactoring, Mining, and Energy (Utilities)), and 
          call it relative_productivity_4sectors.xlsx
          Excel files relative_productivity_4sectors.xlsx, OECD_4sectors.xlsx, exports.xlsx, and the previous ipr_filtered.xlsx file, with the matlab file called replication_part3_robust, to generate 
          an equivalent of table 3. We then manually format this table into latex.
