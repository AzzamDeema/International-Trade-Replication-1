# **Paper Replication Assignment 1**

## Step 1:
Download files for Paper Replication Assignment 1.

## Step 2: 
The Excel files **exports.xlsx**, **imports.xlsx**, and **gross_output.xlsx**, along with the MATLAB file **replication_d1.m**, are used to compute the **Import Penetration Ratio (IPR)**, generating **ipr_final.xlsx**.

We then filter this file in MATLAB so that we only have **4 sectors** (justification discussed in the accompanying PDF file) to obtain **ipr_filtered.xlsx**.

## Step 3: 
The Excel file **pld_ggdc.xlsx** and the MATLAB file **replication_part2.m** are used to generate an equivalent of Table 2 from the paper for all 12 sectors, and the results are manually formatted into LaTeX using Overleaf.

## Step 4: 
We manually filter (in Excel, not MATLAB) the relative productivity values computed in Table 2, keeping only the 4 sectors (**Agriculture, Manufacturing, Mining, and Energy (Utilities)**), and save it as **relative_productivity_4sectors.xlsx**.

The Excel files **relative_productivity_4sectors.xlsx**, **OECD_4sectors.xlsx**, **exports.xlsx**, and the previously generated **ipr_filtered.xlsx**, along with the MATLAB file **replication_part3_robust.m**, are used to generate an equivalent of Table 3. We then manually format this table into LaTeX.
